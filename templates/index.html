<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>An application that calculates and displays various statistics for ESPN Fantasy Basketball leagues. A similar website
    for Yahoo leagues is <a href="https://yahoofantasy.warrencrasta.com" target="_blank">here</a>. The
    code/application works for (public) leagues of any size that use H2H Most Cat. scoring.
    For more information and to see the source code of the project, checkout
    the <a href="https://github.com/wcrasta/ESPN-Fantasy-Basketball" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    <font color="black"><strong>NOTE:</strong></font> Running the project locally from the <a
            href="https://github.com/wcrasta/ESPN-Fantasy-Basketball/tree/more-features" target="_blank">more-features
        branch</a> will give you access to more features that are not included on the website. One such feature is the
    ability to determine your Strength of Schedule.
    <br/><br/>
    <font color="red"><strong>TIP:</strong></font> You can check if your league is public by signing out of your ESPN
    account or going Incognito and trying to access your league office page.
    <br/>If your league is private, ask your League Manager to make it public in the League Settings so that you guys
    can use this tool! If your league is private, my application has no way to access your league data.
